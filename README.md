# FUTURE

![Screenshot_20200517_192300](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7103315/82164538-bea0e600-9876-11ea-8d42-c8a1b126d8fb.png)

FUTURE is a completely stand alone, open-source search engine that's focused on privacy and decentralization, so that any user can also self-host their own instance to contribute to a shared index of web pages accessible through any one of them. Given the small index that it currently has, it also works as a meta-search engine, mixing its own results with others from public Searx instances, to be capable of answering any request properly. [Here is a small presentation](https://future-pitch.glitch.me/#0) that serves to show why FUTURE is different, better and how it accomplishes that.

The decentralization aspect of the search engine is a core feature as it allows anyone to expand the index and improve the service, while also increasing reliability by redundancy. Currently the main node is located at https://wearebuildingthefuture.com.

If you are planning to host your own instance, we strongly encourage you to consider using [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/en/) as they offer an excellent service and instances for a fair price.
