NAME:   FUTURE
DESCRPTION:

    FUTURE is a search engine that improves on traditional methods of search by keyword
    by instead relying on machine learning techniques to encode words as vectors, and
    capture their meaning and be able to return more precise matches, all while dropping
    user tracking as only the query is sufficient to retrieve meaningful data.
    It was written with Python for backend, using Tensorflow and PyTorch and web
    technologies like HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend.
